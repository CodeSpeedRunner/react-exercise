# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
## Requirements:
	1.	Create a React application with at least three main components: SearchBar, RepositoryList, and RepositoryDetail.
	2.	Implement a search functionality using the GitHub API. Allow users to enter a GitHub username and fetch and display a list of repositories associated with that user.
	3.	Display the repository list in the RepositoryList component, showing the repository name, description, and the number of stars.
	4.	When a user clicks on a repository in the list, display detailed information about that repository in the RepositoryDetail component. This should include the repository’s name, description, owner’s username, number of stars, and a link to the repository on GitHub.
	5.	Implement error handling for API calls and display appropriate error messages.
	6.	Add pagination to the repository list. Display a limited number of repositories per page and allow users to navigate between pages.
## All tasks are done.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
